# Holiday Manager Project

## What it is
This project represents a command line application to track holidays internally in an organization.

## What I Learned
- Web Scraping
- Dataclasses
- Methods
- Accessing APIs

## What I Want to Improve
- I was able to access the Weather API for the dates required, but had trouble formatting the weather text to print alongside the holiday name and date.
- I also struggled with providing a different exit experience if the content was saved and opted for a basic exit that didn't differ based on saved status.
- Although I got more comfortable with Python basics as I went along, I still struggled a bit with type errors and iterating.
- I don't understand the function of adding "helping" functions/methods to dataclasses, and I want to look for simple examples that show how they work.
