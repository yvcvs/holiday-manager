# Holiday Manager Project

## What it is
This project represents a command line application to track holidays internally in an organization.

## What I Learned
- Web Scraping
- Dataclasses
- Methods

## What I Want to Improve
- I wasn't able to use a Weather API to access weather data. I want to be able to do so and update this project.
- Although I got more comfortable with Python basics as I went along, I still struggled a bit with type errors and iterating.
